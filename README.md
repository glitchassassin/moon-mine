# Codename "Moon Mine"

1. Write code
2. Mine the moon
3. ???
4. Profit

"Moon Mine" (working title) is a massively multiplayer real-time strategy game that you don't actually play - humans are too slow. Instead, you write an agent to play the game for you.

Write your code in your favorite language - Javascript, Python, or anything that compiles to WASM. Upload your agent and let it spawn units, build structures, and make decisions.

Compete for resources with other players on a single, massive, procedurally-generated map. Protect your harvest from raiders - or go raiding yourself.
